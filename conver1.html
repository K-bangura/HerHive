I know it’s something many of us have experienced, witnessed, or know someone affected by. I think it’s important to start by recognizing that GBV can take many forms—physical, emotional, financial, and even cultural. What comes to mind when you think about GBV?</p>

                    <p class="message-text">For me, it’s not just about the physical harm. Emotional abuse can be just as damaging, sometimes even more so. I've had friends who’ve been controlled and isolated by their partners, but they don’t see it as violence because there are no bruises. It’s painful to see because they think it’s normal or that it’s their fault.</p>

                    <p class="message-text">Exactly, Maria. I agree, and I think in many cultures—including mine—there’s often an acceptance of certain behaviors as “normal.” There’s this idea that a man has a right to control his wife or partner, and it’s reinforced by family members. Many women are afraid to speak up, not only because of fear of backlash but because they don’t realize they have the right to speak up.</p>

                    <p class="message-text">Yes, and that fear is real. I work with young women in schools, and it breaks my heart to hear them talk about harassment and violence as if it’s something they just have to accept. They say things like, “That’s just how men are,” or “I must’ve done something wrong.” They’re internalizing this idea that it’s their responsibility to avoid violence, which is unfair and damaging.</p>

                    <p class="message-text">Absolutely, Joy. I think a big part of the issue is how society treats gender-based violence as a private issue rather than a public one. Women are told not to talk about it or to handle it within their families, which just silences them more. And then there’s the lack of support. If a woman does come forward, she’s often left to navigate it alone, without enough resources to protect her or help her heal.</p>

                    <p class="message-text">That’s so true. And I think the lack of support is also why so many women stay in abusive relationships. They don’t see any alternatives. If there were more safe spaces or shelters and more open dialogue, maybe more women would feel empowered to leave abusive situations.</p>

                    <p class="message-text">Education is another key, both for women and men. I think it’s essential to teach young people about healthy relationships, boundaries, and consent. If we start early, we can change the way society views gender-based violence and shift mindsets. We need to talk to boys about respect and empathy, not just to girls about protecting themselves.</p>
